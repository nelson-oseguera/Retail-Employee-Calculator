# Retail-Employee-Calculator
The program will ask for the monthly sales of a store owned by a company. If the store's monthly sales equal or exceed $100,000 then the company will reward the store with a $5000 bonus. If the store's monthly sales equal or exceed 125% of their monthly goal of $90,000, then all employees will receive a message stating that they will get a day off.
